## Milestone 1 Feedback
Your Purpose, Audience, and Goal section are done very well. They tell me exactly what you're aiming to do with your personal site. The purpose of your site is not something that is done very often in this class, which is cool, and I'm interested to see how you will make your site display this information while also making it eye catching to the audience.

Your Persona clearly describes someone, but I'm not sure how your personal site will help this person. Is Ryan an actor who you are building the site for? I'm a little confused.

The Use Case needs more information. Relate it back to Ryan Kilgore, or yourself, depending on who you are making the site for. For example - if you're creating an actor site for Ryan Kilgore that displays his actor portfolio - talk about a producer for a movie who is looking for actors. He receives an application from Ryan that includes a full website. The producer visits the website and is very surprised by what he sees.

Redo the Use case with these sort of things in mind. If you need help, come ask me. I'll show you examples. Also, add more info to the Persona.

Your HTML is structured very well, as is your directory structure. You're doing well and it seems like you're understanding what's going on. Use the notes above to redo the Use Case as soon as you can, and then resend it.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- More info for Persona
- Redo the Use Case to relate back to whoever the website is for, and who will hire them.
- Watch for spelling and grammar issues.

#### Good job. Just needs some changes - you're in Tier I at the moment only because of the missing content. Add that in, and resend it to me and Rochelle, and you will be allowed to advance to milestone 2a

## Milestone 1 Feedback - Part 2
Thanks for clarifying the Persona and Use Case. Since acting resumes can be long and detailed, be sure that you plan out your content and wireframes carefully. Remember that this will be only a one page site (for now), with a contact form. So keep things as simple as you can, while still including all the resume content your really need here.

Your Use Case should actually be from the Casting Director's, Producer's or Director's point of view. It should outline what these people need or are looking for specifically. But let's just move forward for now, and go ahead and get started on Milestone 2&alpha;. There are some errors in your HTML, so take a look at Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

You Milestone 1 passes at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). What we are really looking for here in PWP is a level of detail that you might submit to a client or project manager, but I think you intuitively understand your own Persona and the Use Case well enough to move forward. Go ahead and get started on Milestone 2&alpha; ASAP.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions - Part 2
- On line 4, it should be `UTF-8`
- Each group of `<li>` tags need to be wrapped inside a `<ul>` or `<ol>` tag. like this:
```
<ul>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
</ul>
```
- Line 31 should be &lt;header&gt;
- There should be a &lt;/ul&gt; after line 35.
