## Milestone 1 Feedback
Your Purpose, Audience, and Goal section are done very well. They tell me exactly what you're aiming to do with your personal site. The purpose of your site is not something that is done very often in this class, which is cool, and I'm interested to see how you will make your site display this information while also making it eye catching to the audience.


Your Persona clearly describes someone, but I'm not sure how your personal site will help this person. Is Ryan an actor who you are building the site for? I'm a little confused.

The Use Case needs more information. Relate it back to Ryan Kilgore, or yourself, depending on who you are making the site for. For example - if you're creating an actor site for Ryan Kilgore that displays his actor portfolio - talk about a producer for a movie who is looking for actors. He receives an application from Ryan that includes a full website. The producer visits the website and is very surprised by what he sees.

Redo the Use case with these sort of things in mind. If you need help, come ask me. I'll show you examples. Also, add more info to the Persona.



Your HTML is structured very well, as is your directory structure. You're doing well and it seems like you're understanding what's going on. Use the notes above to redo the Use Case as soon as you can, and then resend it.


### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- More info for Persona
- Redo the Use Case to relate back to whoever the website is for, and who will hire them.
- Watch for spelling and grammar issues.



#### Good job. Just needs some changes - you're in Tier I at the moment only because of the missing content. Add that in, and resend it to me and Rochelle, and you will be allowed to advance to milestone 2a
