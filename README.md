## Milestone 1 Feedback
Your Purpose, Audience, and Goal section are done very well. They tell me exactly what you're aiming to do with your personal site. The purpose of your site is not something that is done very often in this class, which is cool, and I'm interested to see how you will make your site display this information while also making it eye catching to the audience.

Your Persona clearly describes someone, but I'm not sure how your personal site will help this person. Is Ryan an actor who you are building the site for? I'm a little confused.

The Use Case needs more information. Relate it back to Ryan Kilgore, or yourself, depending on who you are making the site for. For example - if you're creating an actor site for Ryan Kilgore that displays his actor portfolio - talk about a producer for a movie who is looking for actors. He receives an application from Ryan that includes a full website. The producer visits the website and is very surprised by what he sees.

Redo the Use case with these sort of things in mind. If you need help, come ask me. I'll show you examples. Also, add more info to the Persona.

Your HTML is structured very well, as is your directory structure. You're doing well and it seems like you're understanding what's going on. Use the notes above to redo the Use Case as soon as you can, and then resend it.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- More info for Persona
- Redo the Use Case to relate back to whoever the website is for, and who will hire them.
- Watch for spelling and grammar issues.

#### Good job. Just needs some changes - you're in Tier I at the moment only because of the missing content. Add that in, and resend it to me and Rochelle, and you will be allowed to advance to milestone 2a

## Milestone 1 Feedback - Part 2
Thanks for clarifying the Persona and Use Case. Since acting resumes can be long and detailed, be sure that you plan out your content and wireframes carefully. Remember that this will be only a one page site (for now), with a contact form. So keep things as simple as you can, while still including all the resume content your really need here.

Your Use Case should actually be from the Casting Director's, Producer's or Director's point of view. It should outline what these people need or are looking for specifically. But let's just move forward for now, and go ahead and get started on Milestone 2&alpha;. There are some errors in your HTML, so take a look at Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

You Milestone 1 passes at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). What we are really looking for here in PWP is a level of detail that you might submit to a client or project manager, but I think you intuitively understand your own Persona and the Use Case well enough to move forward. Go ahead and get started on Milestone 2&alpha; ASAP.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions - Part 2
- On line 4, it should be `UTF-8`
- Each group of `<li>` tags need to be wrapped inside a `<ul>` or `<ol>` tag. like this:
```
<ul>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
</ul>
```
- Line 31 should be &lt;header&gt;
- There should be a &lt;/ul&gt; after line 35. 








## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Great Wireframes! You've done a great job outlining the layout of this site. Nice work.

I do notice that you didn't write anything about the content strategy of your site - make sure you think about that. This section would basically just explain each part of your site and what will be included there.

Your home page seems very clean and simple, and it looks like it will grab the attention of the user with pictures, which is good. I would suggest you also include a section "About You" on the home page (Unless actors don't do that. I'm not an actor, I build websites and break cars).

A good use of any extra time you have should be used gathering images, content, and any other assets that you will be using on the site. This will speed up the final development process and give you more time to style and polish the site before it is published. Also, think about color schemes, fonts, and other styling options you can use to personalize your site.

For custom fonts, I recommend using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

One of the guidelines that we have for your personal websites is that it is a single page website. I can see that you have multiple links going to other pages of your website - think of a way to compress these into one good looking page. That shouldn't be too difficult with the content you have so far. Create a good looking landing section containing what you want the user to see first, and then fill in the sections below with the other content. You can still have a navbar at the top, but instead of linking to other pages on your site, perhaps you can have it link to your GitHub (if you want to also look for a web development job.) or your Resume.


Great use of Social Media icons. For these icons, have a look Font Awesome. Very easy to use, simple and straightforward.

When you do begin development, you'll build your page on `index.php` directly inside your `/public_html` directory.


Your HTML Structure for this new code needs a little reorganization, but otherwise it's done very well.

Milestone 2 SHOULD have gone in a separate directory from Milestone 1. This isn't a big deal, but I thought I'd mention it.

I would suggest linking your Resume in a downloadable link rather than a section on your page - it's just taking up space since you'll have to limit it to one page either way.

Instead of Recent Roles, I would suggest actually including an image gallery, possibly using pictures of the titles you were in? Think about this as an option, because it would definitely improve the UX of the site and add some color. 



##Nice work here. Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).
