					<h2> Persona </h2>
				</header>
				<li> Well Im 35 and rarely act my age and being as I don't have a family or wife I might as well go after the biggest scariest thing for me.As an aspiring actor I am always looking for the professional edge above the rest. I have been trying to break into the entertainment industry for 10 years now with only mediocre results. Since a lot of the casting can be done nation wide through technology, why not make it look good? With the ability to send your Video real, Head shots, and resume to agents and audition in New York to L.A. all in a day.

					<h3>Use Case</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>The site would be a nicer IMDB of sorts  but about you, while making it an easier method for casting directors or Producers to locate the actors they need for a production involving commercials, films and telivision. They could easily watch your video real, Headshots and resume. With the option to downlad a digital or printable copy for there own use. </li>
